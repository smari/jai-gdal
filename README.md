# GDAL bindings for Jai

Basic [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) bindings for the Jai programming language. See `test.jai` for example usage.

Caveats:
 * Not all functionality is bound or covered. GDAL is a huge library.
 * Currently not everything is tested, but everything covered in `test.jai` should work fine at least.
